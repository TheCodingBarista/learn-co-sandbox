Identify the Problem
When you run into a programming problem, it's easy to get lost in the code. Take a step back and think about what you're trying to accomplish beyond the output. What is the essential goal you're trying to reach? For example, what are the needs of the customer you're coding for? Determining the answer to this establishes your context and makes sure you keep the appropriate perspective on the reality of the problem.

Identify the Output That Would Solve the Problem
After you've figured out what general solution you want, it's time to get a little more specific. What output is going to fit that solution? For example, maybe you can pinpoint that your result should be an average of numbers, or a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. Or a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, divided diagonally into two triangles. Or a beautiful Persian rug that really ties the room together. It all depends on what the problem is. But once you've determined the precise output, you can start building a plan towards it.

Name the Procedure That Fixes the Problem
What will produce the desired output? If we need that average, we add together all of the values in our set and divide by the number of the values, to get a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. If we need a sandwich, we assemble the peanut butter, jelly and bread, and make a diagonal cut. If we need the perfect Persian rug ... well, that might get complicated. But there are steps to take to get it. Identify the steps and find a place to start.

Identify What Inputs Are Needed to Create the Output
In order to start the steps of getting the output, we have to know what items we're going to need during the process. To continue our examples:

If we want an average of numbers, we need all of those values and the total number of values;
If we want a sandwich, we'll need the ingredients (peanut butter, jelly and bread) and tools (a knife, cutting board, plate);
If we want a rug, we'll need thread, a loom and a pattern (or maybe the address of a rug dealership and directions to get there plus a truck, if we want to skip a few steps).
No input, no output. You now know what your output should be, so figure out what input will get it.

Define the Procedure’s Implementation
Because earlier we named the procedure we'll need to use, we have an idea of what implementation will be like. But, just like how we needed to get detailed about the input, we need to dig into implementation and build out our understanding of its process.

Implementation, simply stated, is the set of steps that combine inputs to produce outputs. If we've clearly identified inputs, desired outputs and necessary procedures, the steps we need to take should fall into place. Let's take the above example of averaging numbers:

Input values
Add values
Output total value
Output number of values
Divide total value by number of values
Output average value
When it comes to code, it's important to remember that you don't only want to implement your solution, you want to optimize your implementation. To find ways to keep your implementation simple and readable, you can use documentation to see if heavy lifting work has already been done for you. If you see that it has, but you don’t understand how to use it, test out the code and bring your new understanding to your implementation’s design.

Translate the Procedure Description into Code
Okay. Got all that? Now ... let's code it. Take the description of the procedure you came up with and, guided by the syntax of the particular language you're working with, translate it into code. We've done so much work before this point that while the coding part might not necessarily be easy, you will at least have every advantage you could have to make it flow better for you.

Verify the Procedure’s Output
You've got your code. It's go time. Test it out! What output did you get? If it wasn't your desired output, don't worry too much about it. Testing and revision is a natural part of the programming process. Now we have a sub-process to loop through:

Adjust input
Adjust implementation
Spin-off sub-procedures
Verify output (if necessary)
Move from success to success, accumulating success
